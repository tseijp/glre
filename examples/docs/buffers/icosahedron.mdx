## Icosahedron Props

| **radius** | The icosahedron radius.<br />Default is `1`.                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **detail** | Subdivision level for face refinement.<br />Value `0` creates the base 20-sided polyhedron.<br />Higher values increase vertex density through recursive subdivision.<br />Default is `0`. |

### Geometric Foundation

The icosahedron represents one of the five Platonic solids, characterized by 20 equilateral triangular faces, 12 vertices, and 30 edges. Its construction utilizes the golden ratio $\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$, creating vertices at coordinates involving this mathematical constant.

The base geometry positions vertices using golden ratio relationships. Each vertex coordinate follows the pattern where one component equals $\pm 1$, another equals $\pm \phi$, and the third equals zero. This arrangement produces the characteristic icosahedral symmetry.

### Mathematical Structure

The icosahedron's vertices satisfy the equation:

$$
V = \{(\pm 1, \pm \phi, 0), (0, \pm 1, \pm \phi), (\pm \phi, 0, \pm 1)\}
$$

where $\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618$.

Face connectivity creates 20 triangular surfaces through specific vertex index arrangements. The topology ensures each vertex connects to exactly five faces, maintaining the icosahedron's regular structure.

### Subdivision Algorithm

When `detail > 0`, the function applies recursive face subdivision. Each triangular face divides into smaller triangles through edge midpoint calculation and subsequent triangle generation.

The subdivision process:

1. Creates intermediate vertices along triangle edges
2. Projects new vertices onto the circumsphere
3. Generates additional triangular faces from subdivided regions
4. Maintains surface connectivity throughout the process

Higher detail values produce geodesic sphere approximations with increasingly uniform vertex distribution.

### Vertex Normalization

All vertices undergo normalization to unit length followed by radius scaling. This transformation projects the polyhedron onto a sphere of the specified radius while preserving the underlying icosahedral structure.

The normalization formula:

$$
v_{normalized} = \frac{v}{|v|} \times radius
$$

where $v$ represents the original vertex position and $|v|$ denotes its magnitude.

### Applications in Computational Graphics

Icosahedra serve as foundation geometries for geodesic dome construction, spherical mapping systems, and planetary tessellation. The uniform triangle distribution makes them suitable for particle systems and procedural surface generation.

The subdivision capability allows adaptive level-of-detail control, balancing geometric fidelity with computational requirements. Lower detail values provide efficient base geometry, while higher subdivision levels enable smooth spherical surfaces.
