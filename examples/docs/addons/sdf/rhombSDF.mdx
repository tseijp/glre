# rhombSDF: Diamond Shape Distance Field

### Composite Geometry from Triangle Intersection

The `rhombSDF` function creates a rhombus (diamond) shape by combining two triangular distance fields. This approach demonstrates geometric composition through the maximum operation of transformed triangle primitives.

## Mathematical Foundation

The rhombus is constructed by taking the maximum distance of two triangles:

$$
d_{rhombus}(p) = \max(d_{tri}(p), d_{tri}(p'))
$$

where $p'$ represents the vertically flipped coordinate $(p_x, 1 - p_y)$ for the second triangle.

The maximum operation creates the intersection of the two triangular half-spaces, forming the characteristic diamond shape with four equal sides meeting at right angles.

## Function Signature

| Parameter | Type   | Description            |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| `st`      | `vec2` | 2D coordinate position |

## Implementation Demonstrations

<FragmentEditor
        code={`
const fragment = () => {
        const dist = rhombSDF(uv)
        return vec4(vec3(dist), 1)
}`}
/>
