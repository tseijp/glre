# cubicIn: Sharp Cubic Acceleration Function

### Mathematical Foundation for Pronounced Acceleration

The `cubicIn` function implements cubic acceleration through third-degree polynomial progression. This creates dramatic transitions from rest to movement with sharp initial acceleration curves.

$$
f(t) = t^3 \quad \text{where } t \in [0, 1]
$$

The cubic relationship establishes steep acceleration curves that remain close to zero for extended periods before rapidly increasing near the endpoint.

### Velocity Profile Analysis

The derivative reveals quadratic acceleration throughout the animation duration, creating exponential velocity growth.

$$
\frac{df}{dt} = 3t^2
$$

This quadratic acceleration profile produces very slow initial movement followed by dramatic speed increases, ideal for attention-grabbing motion effects.

### Geometric Interpretation

The function traces a cubic curve that stays significantly below the linear diagonal for most of its domain, then sharply curves upward. This creates the characteristic slow-start, fast-finish acceleration behavior.

        const marker = t.sub(uv.x).abs().sub(0.003).step(0).mul(cubic)
        return vec4(curve.add(marker), curve.mul(0.5), curve.add(marker), 1)
}`}

The implementation demonstrates cubic acceleration where motion remains minimal initially then accelerates dramatically, creating sharp curve distinctions from linear progression.
