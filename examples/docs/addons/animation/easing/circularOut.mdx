# circularOut: Circular Arc Deceleration Function

### Mathematical Foundation for Circular Deceleration

The `circularOut` function applies circular arc transformation creating deceleration curves derived from quarter-circle geometry with curved initial motion smoothing to gentle completion.

$$
f(t) = \sqrt{t(2 - t)}
$$

This circular relationship generates motion profiles following inverted circular arc geometry where velocity decreases smoothly according to circular mathematical characteristics.

### Circular Arc Deceleration

The derivative reveals circular deceleration patterns derived from the geometry of a rotated quarter-circle arc.

$$
\frac{df}{dt} = \frac{1 - t}{\sqrt{t(2 - t)}}
$$

This creates deceleration that follows circular arc geometry, producing distinctive curved smooth motion profiles based on inverted circular mathematical relationships.

The implementation demonstrates circular deceleration behavior where motion follows inverted quarter-circle arc geometry creating smooth curved deceleration through circular mathematical transformation.
