# linearIn: Identity Easing Function

### Mathematical Foundation for Uniform Animation Timing

The `linearIn` function represents the identity mapping in animation interpolation. This function maintains constant velocity throughout the animation duration, creating uniform motion without acceleration or deceleration.

$$
f(t) = t \quad \text{where } t \in [0, 1]
$$

This direct mapping preserves the linear relationship between time and animation progress, making it the foundation for understanding more complex easing behaviors.

### Core Implementation Properties

The function exhibits several fundamental characteristics that define linear interpolation behavior. The derivative remains constant at unity across the entire domain, indicating uniform velocity without variation.

$$
\frac{df}{dt} = 1
$$

This mathematical property ensures predictable animation timing where each time unit produces equivalent visual change.
