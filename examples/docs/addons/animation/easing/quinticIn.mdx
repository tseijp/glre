# quinticIn: Fifth-Power Acceleration

### Maximum polynomial acceleration creating extremely delayed motion onset

The quinticIn function produces the most extreme polynomial acceleration through fifth-power scaling. This creates extraordinarily slow initial motion with explosive final acceleration.

$$f(t) = t^5$$

The quintic relationship represents the highest polynomial power commonly used in easing curves, maximizing the contrast between initial stillness and final motion.
