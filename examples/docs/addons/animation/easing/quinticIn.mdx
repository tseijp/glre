# quinticIn: Fifth-Order Acceleration Function

### Mathematical Foundation for Maximum Smooth-to-Sharp Acceleration

The `quinticIn` function applies fifth-degree polynomial transformation creating acceleration curves with extremely gentle initial motion that builds to maximum sharp increases near completion.

$$
f(t) = t^5
$$

This fifth-power relationship generates motion profiles where velocity increases more dramatically than any lower-order polynomial as the input approaches unity, creating the smoothest starts with the most pronounced acceleration toward the end.

### Acceleration Analysis

The derivative reveals quartic acceleration patterns that build momentum progressively with maximum intensity throughout the motion cycle.

$$
\frac{df}{dt} = 5t^4
$$

This creates zero initial velocity with acceleration that builds quartically, producing the most extreme smooth-start sharp-finish motion profile among standard polynomial functions.

const fragment = () => {
        const t = iTime.fract()
        const curve = quinticIn(t)
        const line = uv.x.sub(curve).abs().step(0.01)
        const marker = t.sub(uv.x).abs().step(0.005)

The implementation demonstrates fifth-order acceleration behavior where motion begins most smoothly and builds to maximum sharp intensity through quintic polynomial transformation.
