# linearInOut: Symmetric Linear Transform Function

### Mathematical Invariance in Bidirectional Animation Systems

The `linearInOut` function represents the identity transformation for bidirectional animation contexts. This function maintains mathematical consistency across both acceleration and deceleration phases through uniform velocity distribution.

$$
f(t) = t \quad \text{where } t \in [0, 1]
$$

The mathematical identity ensures symmetric behavior across animation direction changes, making it fundamental for understanding complex easing combinations.

### Velocity Profile Characteristics

Linear functions exhibit constant derivative throughout their domain, providing predictable motion characteristics regardless of directional interpretation.

$$
\frac{df}{dt} = 1 \quad \text{(uniform velocity)}
$$

This constant velocity profile eliminates acceleration artifacts while maintaining temporal consistency across animation transitions.

### Symmetry Properties in Animation Context

The function demonstrates perfect symmetry around the midpoint $t = 0.5$, where input and output maintain equivalent relationships throughout the parameter space.

$$
f(0.5 - \delta) + f(0.5 + \delta) = 1 \quad \text{for all } \delta \in [0, 0.5]
$$

This symmetry property enables seamless transitions between forward and reverse animation sequences.

The implementation demonstrates symmetric motion behavior where acceleration and deceleration phases maintain identical characteristics. The mathematical identity preserves motion predictability while enabling complex animation choreography through function composition.
