# quadraticOut: Parabolic Deceleration Function

### Mathematical Foundation for Smooth Deceleration

The `quadraticOut` function implements parabolic deceleration through inverted quadratic transformation. This creates smooth transitions from movement to rest with gradually decreasing velocity.

$$
f(t) = -t(t - 2) = 2t - t^2 \quad \text{where } t \in [0, 1]
$$

The negative quadratic component produces deceleration curves that avoid abrupt stops while maintaining smooth motion completion.

### Velocity Profile Characteristics

The derivative shows linear deceleration throughout the animation duration, ensuring gradual speed reduction.

$$
\frac{df}{dt} = 2 - 2t
$$

This linear deceleration profile starts with maximum velocity and gradually reduces to zero, creating natural-feeling motion conclusions.

### Geometric Properties

The function traces an inverted parabolic arc, with the curve positioned above the linear diagonal. This geometric relationship creates the characteristic fast-start, slow-finish behavior.

### Practical Implementation Scenarios

Quadratic deceleration excels in closing animations: modal dismissals, menu collapses, and object exits where smooth completion enhances user experience.

The implementation demonstrates decelerating ring expansion where motion begins rapidly and smoothly comes to rest, illustrating natural deceleration patterns.
