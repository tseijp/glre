# quinticInOut: Symmetric Fifth-Order Motion Function

### Mathematical Foundation for Maximum Intensity Dual-Phase Motion

The `quinticInOut` function applies fifth-degree polynomial transformation through piecewise construction, creating symmetric motion profiles with maximum intensity acceleration and deceleration characteristics exceeding all lower-order polynomial variants.

$$
f(t) = \begin{cases}
16t^5 & \text{if } t < 0.5 \\
-\frac{1}{2}(2t-2)^5 + 1 & \text{if } t \geq 0.5
\end{cases}
$$

The piecewise definition maintains continuity at $t = 0.5$ while generating extreme motion profiles through fifth-power scaling that creates the most pronounced visual impact during transitions among polynomial easing functions.

### Velocity Analysis with Quintic Characteristics

The derivative reveals symmetric quartic velocity profiles with maximum intensity acceleration patterns that build extreme velocity at the midpoint transition.

$$
\frac{df}{dt} = \begin{cases}
80t^4 & \text{if } t < 0.5 \\
-5(2t-2)^4 & \text{if } t \geq 0.5
\end{cases}
$$

This produces maximum velocity at $t = 0.5$ with quartic velocity curves that remain minimal at endpoints while generating the most dramatic momentum changes during the central transition phase.

### Fifth-Order Symmetry Properties

The function maintains perfect symmetry around $(0.5, 0.5)$ while exhibiting quintic curve characteristics that generate the most extreme motion profiles among standard polynomial easing functions.

The implementation demonstrates fifth-order symmetric motion behavior where quintic acceleration and deceleration phases create maximum animation intensity with the most pronounced velocity transitions among polynomial easing alternatives.
