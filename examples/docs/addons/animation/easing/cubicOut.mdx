# cubicOut: Cubic Polynomial Deceleration

### Mathematical Foundation of Cubic Deceleration

The cubicOut function implements deceleration through transformed cubic polynomial. The mathematical expression uses $f(t) = (t-1)^3 + 1$, creating smooth deceleration that begins with high velocity and gradually reduces to zero.

The transformation shifts the cubic curve to provide the desired deceleration characteristics while maintaining polynomial smoothness properties. The function starts with maximum velocity and approaches zero velocity asymptotically.

The derivative $f'(t) = 3(t-1)^2$ shows decreasing velocity throughout the motion, characteristic of cubic deceleration curves.

### Polynomial Properties and Motion Quality

Cubic deceleration maintains $C^2$ continuity, providing smooth velocity and acceleration transitions without jarring discontinuities. The motion feels natural and predictable, ideal for concluding animations.

This easing creates motion that settles gracefully into its final position, making it excellent for UI elements that need to appear to "land" softly at their destination.
