# cubicOut: Sharp Cubic Deceleration Function

### Mathematical Foundation for Dramatic Deceleration

The `cubicOut` function implements cubic deceleration through inverted third-degree polynomial transformation. This creates sharp transitions from rapid movement to complete rest.

$$
f(t) = (t-1)^3 + 1 \quad \text{where } t \in [0, 1]
$$

The inverted cubic component produces dramatic deceleration curves that start rapidly then gradually approach the final value with sharp velocity reduction.

### Velocity Profile Characteristics

The derivative shows quadratic deceleration throughout the animation duration, ensuring dramatic speed reduction patterns.

$$
\frac{df}{dt} = 3(t-1)^2
$$

This quadratic deceleration profile begins with maximum velocity and creates sharp speed reductions, producing natural-feeling yet dramatic motion conclusions.

### Geometric Properties

The function traces an inverted cubic curve positioned significantly above the linear diagonal initially, then approaches the endpoint with sharp curvature changes.

The implementation demonstrates cubic deceleration where motion begins rapidly then sharply decelerates to rest, illustrating pronounced velocity reduction patterns.
