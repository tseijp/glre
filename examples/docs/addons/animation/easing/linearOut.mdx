# linearOut: Mirrored Identity Easing Function

### Mathematical Equivalence in Linear Motion Systems

The `linearOut` function maintains mathematical equivalence to linear motion despite its name suggesting output-focused behavior. In linear systems, input and output transformations remain identical across the normalized parameter domain.

$$
f(t) = t \quad \text{where } t \in [0, 1]
$$

This mathematical identity preserves uniform velocity characteristics, making the distinction between "in" and "out" variants purely conventional in linear easing contexts.

### Velocity Profile Analysis

Linear functions exhibit constant derivative across their entire domain, producing uniform acceleration profiles regardless of directional interpretation.

$$
\frac{df}{dt} = 1 \quad \text{(constant velocity)}
$$

The mathematical properties remain invariant under linear transformations, ensuring predictable motion characteristics.
