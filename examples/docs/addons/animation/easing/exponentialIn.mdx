# exponentialIn: Exponential Acceleration Function

### Mathematical Foundation for Exponential Acceleration

The `exponentialIn` function applies exponential transformation creating acceleration curves with extremely smooth initial motion that builds to sharp exponential increases near completion.

$$
f(t) = \begin{cases}
t & \text{if } t = 0 \\
2^{10(t-1)} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

This base-2 exponential relationship generates motion profiles where velocity increases exponentially as the input approaches unity, creating the smoothest possible starts with dramatic exponential acceleration toward the end.

### Exponential Growth Analysis

The derivative reveals exponential acceleration patterns that build momentum according to exponential rather than polynomial characteristics.

$$
\frac{df}{dt} = 10 \ln(2) \cdot 2^{10(t-1)}
$$

This creates near-zero initial velocity with acceleration that builds exponentially, producing distinctive smooth-start exponential-finish motion profiles.

The implementation demonstrates exponential acceleration behavior where motion begins extremely smoothly and builds to sharp exponential intensity through base-2 exponential transformation.
