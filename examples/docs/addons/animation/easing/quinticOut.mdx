# quinticOut: Fifth-Order Deceleration Function

### Mathematical Foundation for Maximum Sharp-to-Smooth Deceleration

The `quinticOut` function applies inverted fifth-degree polynomial transformation creating deceleration curves with maximum sharp initial motion that smooths to extremely gentle completion.

$$
f(t) = 1 - (t-1)^5
$$

This transformation generates motion profiles where velocity decreases more dramatically than any lower-order polynomial from sharp initial movement to smooth completion, providing the maximum intensity inverse characteristics of quintic acceleration.

### Deceleration Analysis

The derivative reveals quartic deceleration patterns that begin with maximum velocity and smooth toward zero completion with extreme gentleness.

$$
\frac{df}{dt} = 5(t-1)^4
$$

This creates maximum initial velocity with deceleration that smooths progressively with quartic characteristics, producing the most extreme sharp-start smooth-finish motion profile among polynomial easing functions.

The implementation demonstrates fifth-order deceleration behavior where motion begins with maximum sharp intensity and smooths to the most gentle completion through inverted quintic polynomial transformation.
