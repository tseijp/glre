# quarticInOut: Symmetric Fourth-Power Motion

### Mirrored quartic curves creating extreme bidirectional acceleration

The quarticInOut function combines fourth-power acceleration and deceleration through scaled piecewise curves. The first half creates dramatic acceleration while the second half mirrors this with equally dramatic deceleration.

$$
f(t) = \begin{cases}
8t^4 & \text{if } t < 0.5 \\
-8(t-1)^4 + 1 & \text{if } t \geq 0.5
\end{cases}
$$

The scaling factor of 8 ensures continuity at the midpoint while maintaining the extreme acceleration characteristics of quartic polynomials throughout both motion phases.
