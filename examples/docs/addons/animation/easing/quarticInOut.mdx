# quarticInOut: Symmetric Fourth-Order Motion Function

### Mathematical Foundation for Extreme Dual-Phase Motion

The `quarticInOut` function applies fourth-degree polynomial transformation through piecewise construction, creating symmetric motion profiles with extreme acceleration and deceleration characteristics more dramatic than cubic variants.

$$
f(t) = \begin{cases}
8t^4 & \text{if } t < 0.5 \\
-8(t-1)^4 + 1 & \text{if } t \geq 0.5
\end{cases}
$$

The piecewise definition maintains continuity at $t = 0.5$ while generating extreme motion profiles through fourth-power scaling that creates pronounced visual impact during transitions.

### Velocity Analysis with Quartic Characteristics

The derivative reveals symmetric cubic velocity profiles with extreme acceleration patterns that build maximum velocity at the midpoint transition.

$$
\frac{df}{dt} = \begin{cases}
32t^3 & \text{if } t < 0.5 \\
-32(t-1)^3 & \text{if } t \geq 0.5
\end{cases}
$$

This produces maximum velocity at $t = 0.5$ with cubic velocity curves that remain minimal at endpoints while generating dramatic momentum changes during the central transition phase.

### Fourth-Order Symmetry Properties

The function maintains perfect symmetry around $(0.5, 0.5)$ while exhibiting quartic curve characteristics that generate more pronounced motion profiles than lower-order polynomial alternatives.

The implementation demonstrates fourth-order symmetric motion behavior where quartic acceleration and deceleration phases create extreme animation dynamics with pronounced velocity transitions beyond cubic alternatives.
