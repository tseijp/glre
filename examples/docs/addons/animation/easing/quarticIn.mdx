# quarticIn: Fourth-Power Acceleration

### Extreme polynomial acceleration from near-zero motion

The quarticIn function creates dramatic acceleration through fourth-power scaling. This produces extremely slow initial motion followed by rapid acceleration toward completion.

$$f(t) = t^4$$

The quartic relationship amplifies the acceleration effect beyond quadratic and cubic curves. Values remain close to zero for extended periods before experiencing dramatic velocity increases.
