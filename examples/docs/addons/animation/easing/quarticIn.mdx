# quarticIn: Fourth-Order Acceleration Function

### Mathematical Foundation for Smooth-to-Sharp Acceleration

The `quarticIn` function applies fourth-degree polynomial transformation creating acceleration curves with gentle initial motion that builds to sharp increases near completion.

$$
f(t) = t^4
$$

This simple fourth-power relationship generates motion profiles where velocity increases dramatically as the input approaches unity, creating smooth starts with pronounced acceleration toward the end.

### Acceleration Analysis

The derivative reveals cubic acceleration patterns that build momentum progressively throughout the motion cycle.

$$
\frac{df}{dt} = 4t^3
$$

This creates zero initial velocity with acceleration that builds cubically, producing the characteristic smooth-start sharp-finish motion profile.

        code={`
const fragment = () => {
        const t = iTime.fract()
        const curve = quarticIn(t)
        const line = uv.x.sub(curve).abs().step(0.01)
        const marker = t.sub(uv.x).abs().step(0.005)
        return vec4(line, marker, 0, 1)
}`}

The implementation demonstrates fourth-order acceleration behavior where motion begins smoothly and builds to sharp intensity through quartic polynomial transformation.
