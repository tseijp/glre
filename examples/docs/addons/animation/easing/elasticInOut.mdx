# elasticInOut: Symmetric Elastic Motion

### Mathematical Structure of Bidirectional Elastic Behavior

The elasticInOut function creates symmetric elastic motion by combining scaled elastic acceleration and deceleration phases. The mathematical foundation uses modified sinusoidal and exponential components for each half of the motion.

The piecewise construction ensures elastic oscillations occur at both the beginning and end of the motion, creating a spring-like behavior that feels natural and dynamic.
