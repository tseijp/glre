# exponentialOut: Exponential Deceleration Function

### Mathematical Foundation for Exponential Deceleration

The `exponentialOut` function applies inverted exponential transformation creating deceleration curves with sharp exponential initial motion that smooths to extremely gentle completion.

$$
f(t) = \begin{cases}
t & \text{if } t = 1 \\
1 - 2^{-10t} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

This transformation generates motion profiles where velocity decreases exponentially from sharp initial movement to smooth completion, providing distinctive exponential deceleration characteristics.

### Exponential Decay Analysis

The derivative reveals exponential deceleration patterns that begin with high velocity and decay exponentially toward zero completion.

$$
\frac{df}{dt} = 10 \ln(2) \cdot 2^{-10t}
$$

This creates maximum initial velocity with deceleration that smooths exponentially, producing distinctive sharp-start smooth-finish motion profiles through exponential decay.

The implementation demonstrates exponential deceleration behavior where motion begins with sharp exponential intensity and smooths to extremely gentle completion through inverted exponential transformation.
