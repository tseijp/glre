# quarticOut: Fourth-Order Deceleration Function

### Mathematical Foundation for Sharp-to-Smooth Deceleration

The `quarticOut` function applies inverted fourth-degree polynomial transformation creating deceleration curves with sharp initial motion that smooths to gentle completion.

$$
f(t) = (t-1)^3 \cdot (1-t) + 1
$$

This transformation generates motion profiles where velocity decreases dramatically from sharp initial movement to smooth completion, providing the inverse characteristics of quartic acceleration.

### Deceleration Analysis

The derivative reveals complex deceleration patterns that begin with high velocity and smooth toward zero completion.

$$
\frac{df}{dt} = 3(t-1)^2 \cdot (1-t) - (t-1)^3
$$

This creates maximum initial velocity with deceleration that smooths progressively, producing the characteristic sharp-start smooth-finish motion profile.

The implementation demonstrates fourth-order deceleration behavior where motion begins with sharp intensity and smooths to gentle completion through inverted quartic polynomial transformation.
