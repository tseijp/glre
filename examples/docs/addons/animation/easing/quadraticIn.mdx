# quadraticIn: Parabolic Acceleration Function

### Mathematical Foundation for Smooth Acceleration

The `quadraticIn` function implements parabolic acceleration through quadratic polynomial progression. This creates smooth transitions from rest to movement with gradually increasing velocity.

$$
f(t) = t^2 \quad \text{where } t \in [0, 1]
$$

The quadratic relationship establishes gentle acceleration curves that avoid harsh motion artifacts while maintaining predictable timing characteristics.

### Velocity Profile Analysis

The derivative reveals linear acceleration throughout the animation duration, creating smooth velocity transitions.

$$
\frac{df}{dt} = 2t
$$

This linear acceleration profile ensures gradual speed increases, making it ideal for natural-feeling motion that starts slowly and builds momentum.

### Geometric Interpretation

The function traces a parabolic arc from origin $(0,0)$ to endpoint $(1,1)$, with the curve lying below the linear diagonal. This geometric property creates the characteristic slow-start acceleration behavior.

### Animation Context Applications

Quadratic acceleration suits scenarios requiring gentle motion initiation: dropdown menus, sliding panels, and object entrances where abrupt movement would feel jarring.

The implementation demonstrates accelerating wave propagation where motion starts gradually and builds momentum, creating natural-feeling animation progressions.
