# circularIn: Circular Arc Acceleration Function

### Mathematical Foundation for Circular Acceleration

The `circularIn` function applies circular arc transformation creating acceleration curves derived from quarter-circle geometry with smooth initial motion building to curved increases.

$$
f(t) = 1 - \sqrt{1 - t^2}
$$

This quarter-circle relationship generates motion profiles following circular arc geometry where velocity increases smoothly according to circular rather than polynomial or exponential characteristics.

### Circular Arc Geometry

The derivative reveals circular acceleration patterns derived from the geometry of a unit circle's first quadrant.

$$
\frac{df}{dt} = \frac{t}{\sqrt{1 - t^2}}
$$

This creates acceleration that follows circular arc geometry, producing distinctive smooth curved motion profiles based on circular mathematical relationships.

The implementation demonstrates circular acceleration behavior where motion follows quarter-circle arc geometry creating smooth curved acceleration through circular mathematical transformation.
