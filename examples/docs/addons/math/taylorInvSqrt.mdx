# taylorInvSqrt: Taylor Series Inverse Square Root Approximation

### Fast Mathematical Approximation for Graphics Programming

The Taylor inverse square root function provides a rapid approximation of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{r}}$ using polynomial expansion. This technique sacrifices precision for computational speed, making it valuable in real-time graphics applications where normalization operations dominate performance.

The mathematical foundation rests on the Taylor series expansion around a carefully chosen point, yielding the linear approximation:

$$
\text{taylorInvSqrt}(r) = 1.79284291400159 - 0.85373472095314 \cdot r
$$

This approximation maintains reasonable accuracy within the range $r \in [0.5, 2.0]$, where the linear model closely follows the true inverse square root curve. Beyond this interval, deviation increases exponentially, creating distinct visual artifacts that reveal the approximation's mathematical boundaries.

### Frequency Domain Analysis

The approximation's linear nature creates unique harmonic distortions when applied to oscillating functions. This mathematical property generates distinctive interference patterns that expose the polynomial's spectral characteristics:
