# blendSubtract: Additive Threshold Clamping Mode

### Unity-Based Threshold Function for High-Luminance Extraction

The subtract blend mode applies an additive threshold operation where color values persist only when the combined luminance exceeds unity. This creates high-contrast selections based on luminance accumulation.

The mathematical definition uses threshold clamping:

$$
\text{subtract}(base, blend) = \max(base + blend - 1, 0)
$$

Values below the unity threshold are eliminated, while excess luminance above 1.0 creates the final result. This produces stark binary separations between preserved and eliminated regions.
