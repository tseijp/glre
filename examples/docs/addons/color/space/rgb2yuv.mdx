# rgb2yuv: RGB to Broadcast Color Space Conversion

### Mathematical Structure of Video Color Separation

RGB to YUV conversion separates luminance information from chrominance data, optimizing video signal transmission and storage. The transformation computes perceived brightness independently from color content.

The mathematical transformation:
$$\text{YUV} = M_{\text{RGB}\rightarrow\text{YUV}} \cdot \text{RGB}$$

Where Y represents luminance (brightness), U encodes blue-yellow color difference, and V encodes red-cyan color difference.

### Luminance Calculation Properties

The Y component computes perceptually weighted brightness using coefficients derived from human visual sensitivity. Green contributes most heavily to perceived brightness, followed by red, then blue.

Mathematical characteristics:

- **Luminance weighting**: Green channel receives highest coefficient due to eye sensitivity
- **Chrominance encoding**: U and V represent color deviations from grayscale
- **Bandwidth optimization**: Chrominance components can be subsampled without perceptual loss
