## Tutorial Features

### Progressive Learning

Each chapter builds on previous knowledge, allowing you to learn techniques step by step.

### Hands-On Approach

Not just theory - write actual code and see immediate results on screen.

### Visual Understanding

Code results are instantly visible, making concepts intuitive to grasp.

## Community and Support

### Learning Resources

- ðŸ“š **Official Documentation**: Technical reference
- ðŸŽ¨ **Sample Gallery**: Various visual examples
- ðŸ’¬ **Community Forum**: Q&A exchange

### Learning Tips

1. **Take small steps**: Don't try to learn everything at once
2. **Actually write code**: Don't just copy-paste, write it yourself
3. **Enjoy trial and error**: Mistakes and unexpected results are part of learning
4. **Create projects**: Combine learned techniques to build original works

## Math Concepts Made Simple

### Understanding Numbers in Graphics

In visual programming, we work with different types of numbers:

- **Coordinates**: Numbers that tell us where something is on screen
- **Colors**: Numbers that represent how bright red, green, and blue should be
- **Time**: Numbers that change continuously to create animation
- **Angles**: Numbers that control rotation (like the hands of a clock)

### No Advanced Math Required

You don't need to understand complex mathematics. GLRE handles the difficult parts automatically. You just need to understand:

- Adding and subtracting numbers
- Multiplying numbers (making things bigger/smaller)
- What coordinates mean (like finding a location on a map)

## Next Steps

When you're ready, start with [Getting Started](fundamentals/01-getting-started.md) to begin your journey.
